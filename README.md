## Dos Tool

# !!! Disclaimer !!!

This tool wasn't created by me or Ultimate Developers, it was developed by depascaldc (Original repository ---> [link](https://github.com/depascaldc/DoS-Tool) )
I added a log system that saves everything on txt files


# Use

Run the code on Visual Studio
Insert all the data required 

Once the dos is finished on the "Logs" folder you will find all the logs
